		<li class="centered-text">"I have attended two weeklong courses and both times the course was excellent. The instructor was well-organized, and I was given information that I had not found elsewhere. I am a survivor of domestic violence, and the class gave me the confidence and the courage to finally advocate for myself. The class has in-depth instruction covering a broad range of topics and practical advice on the ways to stay safe in your own home, in your car, walking down the street, and in public places. Highly Recommended!"</li>

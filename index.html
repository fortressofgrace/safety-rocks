	<p class="centered-text">Fortress of Grace is a private, faith-based business that is dedicated to empowering women through educational self-defense programs. Our mission is to equip women with the knowledge and confidence to protect themselves, grounded in biblical principles of strength, grace, and wisdom. We offer comprehensive education focused on personal safety, awareness, and spiritual resilience, all within a supportive and faith-driven environment.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;" class="centered-text"><i>These classes are strictly educational, focusing solely on mental and spiritual preparedness. While many physical self-defense classes are available for those interested, we believe that understanding the mental aspects of self-defense is crucialâ€”90% of effective self-defense is mental, and only 10% is physical. By focusing on awareness, confidence, and mental readiness, we empower participants to avoid or de-escalate threats before any physical response is needed. This approach keeps our sessions informative, safe, and accessible to everyone, without any physical or hands-on training.</i></p>
